title: Getting Started
description: Install ReAuth, configure the engine, and run your first build.
---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18** or newer
- **pnpm** 9 or newer (ReAuth uses pnpm workspaces)
- Access to the ReAuth monorepo or the published packages on npm

## Install the packages

```bash
npm install @re-auth/reauth @re-auth/http-adapters fumadb kysely
```

Add development tooling if you plan to emit SDKs:

```bash
npm install -D @re-auth/sdk-generator
```

## Configure the engine

Create `auth/engine.ts` in your application and wire the core engine together:

```ts
import createReAuthEngine, {
  reauthDb,
  reauthDbVersions,
} from '@re-auth/reauth';
import { kyselyAdapter } from 'fumadb/adapters/kysely';
import emailPasswordPlugin, {
  emailPasswordSchema,
} from '@re-auth/reauth/plugins/email-password';

// Setup database with FumaDB
const { schema: v1 } = reauthDb('1.0.1', [emailPasswordSchema]);
const factory = reauthDbVersions([v1]);
const client = factory.client(
  kyselyAdapter({
    provider: 'postgresql', // or 'sqlite', 'mysql'
    db: kysely,
  }),
);

export const auth = createReAuthEngine({
  dbClient: {
    version: async () => await client.version(),
    orm: (version) => client.orm(version),
  },
  plugins: [
    emailPasswordPlugin({
      verifyEmail: true,
      sendCode: async (subject, code, email, type) => {
        // Send email via your provider (Resend, SendGrid, etc.)
        console.log(`Email to ${email}: ${code}`);
      },
    }),
  ],
  getUserData: async (subjectId, orm) => ({ id: subjectId }),
});
```

The engine is runtime agnostic: you bring your database adapter, plugins, and user data resolver to model your authentication policy.

## Expose the API

Pick a transport adapter from `@re-auth/http-adapters`. For example, setting up Express:

```ts
import express from 'express';
import { createExpressAdapter } from '@re-auth/http-adapters';
import { auth } from './auth/engine';

const app = express();

const adapter = createExpressAdapter({
  auth,
  extractDeviceInfo: (req) => ({
    ip: req.ip,
    userAgent: req.get('user-agent') || '',
  }),
  sessionCookie: {
    name: 'reauth_session',
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    sameSite: 'lax',
  },
});

app.use('/auth', adapter.router);
app.listen(3000);
```

The adapter maps HTTP verbs to the deterministic flows you configured on the engine. ReAuth ships adapters for Express, Fastify, Hono, Next.js app router, and edge runtimes.

## Run the build

After wiring the engine, make sure the packages compile cleanly:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command compiles all packages in the monorepo including:

- `@re-auth/reauth` – the engine
- `@re-auth/http-adapters` – transport integrations
- `@re-auth/sdk-generator` – typed client generator

## Next steps

- Study the [Engine overview](./engine/overview) to understand core concepts.
- Review [HTTP adapters](./http-adapters/overview) for framework-specific guidance.
- Learn how to [generate SDKs](./sdk-generator) and keep clients in sync with your configuration.
