title: Getting Started
description: Install ReAuth, configure the engine, and run your first build.
---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18** or newer
- **pnpm** 9 or newer (ReAuth uses pnpm workspaces)
- Access to the ReAuth monorepo or the published packages on npm

## Install the packages

```bash
pnpm add @re-auth/reauth @re-auth/http-adapters
```

Add development tooling if you plan to emit SDKs:

```bash
pnpm add -D @re-auth/sdk-generator
```

## Configure the engine

Create `auth/engine.ts` in your application and wire the core engine together:

```ts
import { createReAuthEngine } from '@re-auth/reauth';
import { emailPasswordPlugin } from '@re-auth/reauth/plugins/email-password';
import { createKyselyAdapter } from '@re-auth/reauth/lib/adapters/kysely';

export const auth = createReAuthEngine({
  database: createKyselyAdapter({ client: db }),
  plugins: [
    emailPasswordPlugin({
      requireEmailVerification: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

The engine is runtime agnostic: you bring your database adapter, cache implementation, and plugins that model your policy.

## Expose the API

Pick a transport adapter from `@re-auth/http-adapters`. For example, setting up Express:

```ts
import express from 'express';
import { createExpressAdapter } from '@re-auth/http-adapters';
import { auth } from './auth/engine';

const app = express();
const adapter = createExpressAdapter({ engine: auth });

app.use('/auth', adapter.createRouter());
app.listen(3000);
```

The adapter maps HTTP verbs to the deterministic flows you configured on the engine. ReAuth ships adapters for Express, Fastify, Hono, Next.js app router, and edge runtimes.

## Run the build

After wiring the engine, make sure the packages compile cleanly:

```bash
pnpm --filter "@re-auth/*" build
```

This command compiles:

- `@re-auth/reauth` – the engine
- `@re-auth/http-adapters` – transport integrations
- `@re-auth/sdk-generator` – typed client generator

## Next steps

- Study the [Engine overview](./engine/overview) to understand core concepts.
- Review [HTTP adapters](./http-adapters/overview) for framework-specific guidance.
- Learn how to [generate SDKs](./sdk-generator) and keep clients in sync with your configuration.
