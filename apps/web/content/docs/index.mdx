description: Learn how the ReAuth engine, HTTP adapters, and tooling work together.
---

ReAuth is a runtime and protocol agnostic authentication engine for TypeScript and JavaScript environments. These docs walk you through the platform's three layers:

1. The core engine that models identities, sessions, and policy enforcement.
2. Transport adapters that expose the same flows on any server runtime.
3. Tooling that keeps generated SDKs aligned with the server.

## What you will build

- Compose authentication flows with deterministic behavior across runtimes.
- Layer protocol-specific adapters (Express, Hono, Next.js handlers, edge runtimes).
- Generate typed client SDKs that stay in sync with your configuration.

## Where to start

- Read the [Getting Started](./getting-started) guide to install and configure the engine.
- Explore the [Engine](./engine/overview) section for detailed concepts, lifecycle hooks, and advanced configuration.
- Jump to [HTTP Adapters](./http-adapters/overview) to expose your flows over frameworks you already run.
- Use the [SDK Generator](./sdk-generator) to ship consistent clients without manual typing.

Each section includes architecture context, API references, and integration checklists so you can adopt ReAuth incrementally.
