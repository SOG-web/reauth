# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the comprehensive update of ReAuth's documentation ecosystem to accurately reflect its architecture as a runtime, framework, and protocol-independent authentication engine. The design addresses the current misrepresentation in documentation and establishes a clear information architecture that guides developers to understand ReAuth's true capabilities as a universal authentication solution.

## Architecture

### Documentation Structure Redesign

The documentation will be restructured to emphasize the separation of concerns between:

1. **Core Authentication Engine** - Runtime, protocol and framework independent
2. **HTTP Adapters** - Framework-specific integration layers for http protocol
3. **Application Examples** - Real-world implementation demonstrations
4. **Developer Tools** - SDK generation and development utilities

### Information Hierarchy

## Components and Interfaces

### Steering Rules Update

**Product Steering Rule**

- Emphasize runtime and framework independence
- Highlight plugin-based architecture
- Clarify adapter pattern for framework integration
- Position ReAuth as a universal authentication solution

**Technology Steering Rule**

- Update core technology descriptions
- Emphasize adapter pattern implementation
- Clarify build and deployment strategies
- Include framework-agnostic development patterns

**Structure Steering Rule**

- Correct package relationship descriptions
- Emphasize separation between core and adapters
- Update naming conventions to reflect architecture
- Clarify development workflow patterns

### README Documentation Strategy

**Root README Redesign**

- Lead with framework independence messaging
- Provide clear package purpose descriptions
- Include architecture diagram showing engine/adapter separation
- Guide users to appropriate starting points

**Core Package README**

- Focus on engine capabilities independent of frameworks
- Demonstrate plugin system usage
- Show direct API usage examples
- Explain session management and introspection features

**HTTP Adapters README**

- Explain adapter pattern and benefits
- Provide framework-specific integration examples
- Document custom adapter creation process
- Detail auto-introspection and route generation

**Application Example READMEs**

- Show real-world integration patterns
- Demonstrate proper separation of concerns
- Provide runnable examples with clear setup
- Highlight framework-specific considerations

## Data Models

### Documentation Content Model

```typescript
interface DocumentationSection {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  codeExamples: CodeExample[];
  crossReferences: string[];
  targetAudience: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
}

interface CodeExample {
  language: string;
  code: string;
  description: string;
  runnable: boolean;
  dependencies: string[];
}

interface ArchitectureDiagram {
  type: 'mermaid' | 'ascii' | 'image';
  content: string;
  description: string;
}
```

### Package Metadata Updates

```typescript
interface PackageDocumentation {
  name: string;
  description: string; // Updated to reflect true purpose
  keywords: string[]; // Framework-independent terms
  examples: {
    basic: CodeExample;
    advanced: CodeExample;
    integration: CodeExample[];
  };
  architecture: {
    role: 'core' | 'adapter' | 'example' | 'utility';
    dependencies: string[];
    consumers: string[];
  };
}
```

## Error Handling

### Documentation Validation Strategy

1. **Syntax Validation**

   - All code examples must be syntactically correct
   - TypeScript examples must pass type checking
   - Import statements must reference actual exports

2. **Architecture Consistency**

   - Documentation claims must be verified against implementation
   - API references must match actual interfaces
   - Feature descriptions must be supported by code

3. **Cross-Reference Validation**

   - Internal links must resolve correctly
   - Package references must be accurate
   - Version information must be current

4. **Example Verification**
   - All runnable examples must execute successfully
   - Dependencies must be correctly specified
   - Setup instructions must be complete and accurate

## Testing Strategy

### Documentation Testing Approach

1. **Automated Validation**

   - Markdown linting for consistency
   - Code example compilation testing
   - Link validation across all documentation
   - Package.json description validation

2. **Manual Review Process**

   - Architecture accuracy review by maintainers
   - Developer experience testing with fresh eyes
   - Cross-platform compatibility verification
   - Framework integration testing

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Documentation builds on every commit
   - Example code execution in CI pipeline
   - Link checking in automated tests
   - Version consistency validation

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Steering Rules Update**

- Update product.md with correct architecture description
- Revise tech.md to emphasize adapter pattern
- Correct structure.md package relationships
- Validate against actual codebase

**Phase 2: Core Documentation**

- Rewrite root README with framework independence focus
- Update core package README to emphasize engine capabilities
- Create architecture documentation explaining design principles
- Add plugin development guides

**Phase 3: Adapter Documentation**

- Rewrite HTTP adapters README with adapter pattern focus
- Create framework-specific integration guides
- Document custom adapter creation process
- Add troubleshooting and best practices

**Phase 4: Example Applications**

- Update example app READMEs with proper context
- Ensure examples demonstrate correct architecture
- Add setup and deployment instructions
- Create integration pattern documentation

**Phase 5: Validation and Polish**

- Run comprehensive documentation validation
- Test all code examples for accuracy
- Verify cross-references and links
- Conduct developer experience review

### Quality Assurance

1. **Content Accuracy**

   - All technical claims verified against implementation
   - Code examples tested in isolation
   - API documentation matches actual interfaces
   - Version information kept current

2. **Developer Experience**

   - Clear navigation between related concepts
   - Progressive disclosure from basic to advanced topics
   - Consistent terminology throughout documentation
   - Helpful cross-references and examples

3. **Maintenance Strategy**
   - Documentation updates required for API changes
   - Regular review cycles for accuracy
   - Community feedback integration process
   - Version-specific documentation branches

This design ensures that ReAuth's documentation accurately represents its architecture as a runtime, protocol and framework-independent authentication engine, providing developers with clear guidance on how to integrate and extend the system across different environments and use cases.
