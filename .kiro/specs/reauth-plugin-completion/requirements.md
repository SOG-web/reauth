# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for completing all incomplete ReAuth authentication plugins. The ReAuth system currently has several plugins that are either partially implemented, completely commented out, or have initialization errors that prevent them from being used in production. This project aims to bring all plugins to a production-ready state with comprehensive functionality, security measures, and proper testing.

The incomplete plugins identified are: Username Plugin, API Key Plugin, Anonymous Plugin, Organization Plugin, Passwordless Plugin, and Phone Password Plugin. Each plugin has specific issues ranging from initialization errors to missing core functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Plugin Initialization Errors

**User Story:** As a developer using ReAuth, I want all plugins to initialize properly without throwing errors, so that I can use them in my authentication system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer imports and initializes the Username Plugin THEN the plugin SHALL initialize successfully without throwing "work in progress" errors
2. WHEN a developer imports and initializes the API Key Plugin THEN the plugin SHALL initialize successfully without throwing "work in progress" errors
3. WHEN a developer imports and initializes the Anonymous Plugin THEN the plugin SHALL initialize successfully without throwing "work in progress" errors
4. WHEN a developer imports and initializes the Organization Plugin THEN the plugin SHALL initialize successfully without throwing "work in progress" errors
5. WHEN any plugin initializes THEN it SHALL properly register its services in the dependency injection container
6. WHEN any plugin initializes THEN it SHALL validate its required configuration parameters
7. IF a plugin has dependencies on other plugins THEN it SHALL verify those dependencies are available during initialization

### Requirement 2: Restore Passwordless Plugin Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use passwordless authentication methods like magic links and OTP codes, so that I can provide users with convenient authentication options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Passwordless Plugin is imported THEN it SHALL be fully uncommented and functional
2. WHEN a user requests a magic link THEN the system SHALL generate a secure token and send it via the configured method
3. WHEN a user clicks a magic link with a valid token THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and create a session
4. WHEN a user requests an OTP code THEN the system SHALL generate a secure code and send it via SMS or other configured method
5. WHEN a user submits a valid OTP code THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and create a session
6. WHEN a magic link or OTP token expires THEN the system SHALL reject authentication attempts with that token
7. WHEN invalid tokens are submitted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3: Complete Username Plugin Security Features

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the Username Plugin to have comprehensive security measures, so that user accounts are protected from common attacks.

4. WHEN a user sets a password THEN the system SHALL enforce configurable password policies
5. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL verify the current password and enforce security policies
6. WHEN username uniqueness is checked THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions properly
7. WHEN the plugin processes authentication requests THEN it SHALL log security events for auditing

### Requirement 4: Complete API Key Plugin Management Features

**User Story:** As a developer building an API, I want comprehensive API key management functionality, so that I can securely manage programmatic access to my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user creates an API key THEN the system SHALL generate a cryptographically secure key
2. WHEN an API key is used for authentication THEN the system SHALL track usage statistics and last used timestamp
3. WHEN an API key reaches its expiration date THEN the system SHALL reject authentication attempts
4. WHEN an API key is revoked THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate it for future use
5. WHEN API key usage exceeds configured rate limits THEN the system SHALL throttle or reject requests
6. WHEN suspicious API key usage is detected THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for key compromise detection
7. WHEN an API key is rotated THEN the system SHALL provide a secure rotation process
8. WHEN API keys are listed THEN the system SHALL not expose the actual key values for security

### Requirement 5: Complete Anonymous Plugin Data Management

**User Story:** As a developer building an e-commerce or content platform, I want robust anonymous user management, so that I can provide seamless user experiences before registration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an anonymous user is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique anonymous identifier
2. WHEN anonymous user data is stored THEN the system SHALL validate the data according to configured rules
3. WHEN an anonymous user converts to a registered user THEN the system SHALL transfer their data securely
4. WHEN an anonymous user links to an existing account THEN the system SHALL merge data according to configured policies
5. WHEN anonymous user data exceeds retention policies THEN the system SHALL clean up expired data
6. WHEN anonymous user data is processed THEN the system SHALL comply with GDPR and privacy regulations
7. WHEN anonymous sessions are managed THEN the system SHALL handle session lifecycle properly
8. WHEN account linking occurs THEN the system SHALL validate security constraints to prevent abuse

### Requirement 6: Complete Organization Plugin Multi-Tenant Features

**User Story:** As a developer building a multi-tenant application, I want comprehensive organization management, so that I can handle complex permission structures and team management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an organization is created THEN the system SHALL validate organization data and set up proper ownership
2. WHEN users are added to organizations THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate roles and permissions
3. WHEN organization permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL efficiently validate user access rights
4. WHEN organization data is queried THEN the system SHALL enforce proper data isolation between tenants
5. WHEN organization membership changes THEN the system SHALL update user permissions accordingly
6. WHEN organizations are deleted THEN the system SHALL handle cascading deletions and data cleanup properly
7. WHEN organization limits are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce maximum organization counts per user
8. WHEN organization operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information

### Requirement 7: Complete Phone Password Plugin Verification Features

**User Story:** As a developer targeting mobile users, I want complete phone-based authentication, so that users can authenticate using their phone numbers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers with a phone number THEN the system SHALL send a verification code via SMS
2. WHEN a user verifies their phone number THEN the system SHALL mark the phone as verified in their profile
