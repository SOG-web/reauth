# Execution Guidelines

## Task Management

- Follow each task strictly without over-engineering
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components
- Focus on minimal viable implementations that meet requirements
- Create improvement suggestion files to track optimization opportunities
- Always check for existing solutions before implementing new features

## Code Quality Standards

- Write clean, readable code with appropriate comments
- Follow existing patterns and conventions within each application
- Ensure type safety with TypeScript across all projects
- Maintain consistent error handling and logging practices

## Development Workflow

- Test implementations thoroughly before considering tasks complete
- Use existing tooling and scripts defined in package.json files
- Respect the monorepo structure and workspace dependencies
- Follow the established import patterns and module organization

## Error Handling

- Implement robust error handling for all API endpoints
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes for error responses
- Provide clear and concise error messages for debugging
- Log detailed error information for troubleshooting and monitoring

## Security Best Practices

- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Follow secure coding practices for video content delivery

## Documentation

- Update relevant README files when making significant changes
- Document API endpoints and their expected behavior
- Include inline comments for complex business logic
- Maintain accurate environment variable examples
